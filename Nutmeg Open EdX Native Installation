Prep the server
Launch your Ubuntu 20.04 64-bit server and log in to it as a user that has full sudo privileges.

Update your Ubuntu package sources:

$ sudo apt-get update -y
$ sudo apt-get upgrade -y
$ sudo reboot



Installation
You will run a few scripts to accomplish the installation. Please read the contents of the scripts before running this to ensure
you are aware of everything they will do: they are quite extensive. The scripts require that the running user can run commands as root via sudo.

Set the OPENEDX_RELEASE variable. You choose the version of software by setting the OPENEDX_RELEASE variable before running the commands.
See the Open edX Named Releases page for the tags you can use.

$ export OPENEDX_RELEASE=the-tag/you-want-to-install
$ export OPENEDX_RELEASE=open-release/nutmeg.1

Create a config.yml file. This file specifies the hostname (and port, if needed) of the LMS and Studio. Create a file in the current
directory named config.yml, like this:

# The host names of LMS and Studio. Don't include the "https://" part:
EDXAPP_LMS_BASE: "online.myeducation.org"
EDXAPP_CMS_BASE: "studio.online.myeducation.org"

Your LMS host and Studio host must either be the same hostname (on different ports), or Studio must be a subdomain of the LMS.
If you need a different configuration, you may need to also set EDXAPP_SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN.

NOTE : Open edX and edX are registered trademarks. You may not use “openedx.” or “edx.” as subdomains when naming your site.
For more details, see the edX Trademark Policy. Here are some examples of unacceptable domain names:

DON’T: openedx.yourdomain.org
DON’T: edx.yourdomain.org
DON’T: openedxyourdomain.org
DON’T: yourdomain-edx.com



Bootstrap the Ansible installation:

$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edx/configuration/$OPENEDX_RELEASE/util/install/ansible-bootstrap.sh -O - | sudo -E bash
$ wget https://github.com/denzel-gustave/open-edx/blob/main/ansible-bootstrap.sh -O - | sudo -E bash

Warning
DO NOT activate a virtualenv at this point, even if the ansible-bootstrap script tells you to.



Randomize passwords. If this is to replace an older installation, copy your my-passwords.yml file from that installation. If this is a new installation:

$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edx/configuration/$OPENEDX_RELEASE/util/install/generate-passwords.sh -O - | bash
$ wget https://github.com/denzel-gustave/open-edx/blob/main/generate-passwords.sh -O - | bash

IMPORTANT: Be sure to save the generated my-passwords.yml in a safe place. If you ever need to access your services directly,
you’ll need these credentials. More details of password generation and other security measures are here: How to Override
Default Configuration Passwords and Verify Exposed Services.



Install the Open edX software. This can take some time, perhaps an hour. (Note: for Ginkgo and earlier, this file was called sandbox.sh):

$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edx/configuration/$OPENEDX_RELEASE/util/install/native.sh -O - | bash
$ wget https://github.com/denzel-gustave/open-edx/blob/main/native.sh -O - | bash

Finish configuring your server, for example to set the LMS_ROOT_URL setting, before everything will work properly. The Managing Open edX
Tips and Tricks page may be useful.

3.2.2.5. Do not upgrade!
Some Open edX components are outdated. If you see a message suggesting that you update something manually, don’t do it – something
is probably relying on the outdated software remaining at that older version. Specifically:

Ubuntu may alert you that a newer version of Ubuntu available when you SSH in to your server, and may suggest that you run
do-release-upgrade to upgrade to that newer version. Don’t do it.

Pip may alert you that there is a newer version of pip available, and may suggest that you run pip install --upgrade pip to install it. Don’t do it.

If you arbitrarily upgrade parts of Open edX software, things will break. Instead, you should submit a pull request to change
the line in the Open edX project where that specific version of the software is defined. All pull requests need to be reviewed
before they can be merged, and part of the review process will consist of testing the full platform with the updated software,
identifying any breakages, and fixing them as part of the pull request.
